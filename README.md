Use Harris Corner detector to identify corners and edges of image

The objective is to apply the Harris Corner Detector to identify corners and edges in an image and analyze the effects of various transformations on the detection process.

Download the Image – Get the provided image for processing.
Corner Detection – Apply the Harris Corner Detector to compute corner response.
Thresholding – Use a threshold to detect and highlight corners.
Image Modifications – Resize, rotate, adjust brightness/contrast, and repeat corner detection.
Edge Detection – Use the corner response to identify edges.

Dependencies: pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
